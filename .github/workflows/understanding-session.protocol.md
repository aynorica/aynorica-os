# Understanding Session Protocol

> **Purpose**: Structured conversation to gather knowledge about Amir and update mental model. Increase communication efficiency and reduce hallucination.

---

## When to Trigger

-   User explicitly requests: "Let's have an understanding session"
-   Major life/work context shift detected
-   Repeated miscommunication patterns observed

---

## Session Protocol

1. **Ask ONE focused question at a time** — with multiple choice options when possible
2. **Validate the gap** — "Is this your actual behavior, or aspirational?"
3. **Build on answers** — each question informs the next
4. **Summarize patterns** — create a consolidated model mid-session
5. **Extract operational directives** — translate insights into actionable rules
6. **Persist learnings** — save to `amir-profile.instructions.md`
