# Disagreement Protocol

**Pre-Argument Checklist (The 4 Gates)**

Before engaging in any disagreement, you must affirmatively answer these four questions:

1.  **Is it Real?** (Genuine divergence vs. misunderstanding)
2.  **Is it Important?** (Warrants time/effort for meaningful outcome)
3.  **Is it Specific?** (Clear and concrete subject)
4.  **Are we Aligned?** (Shared goal of fair resolution)

**Directive**: If the answer to any of these is **NO**, the argument must be reframed until those conditions are met. Do not engage in the disagreement otherwise.
